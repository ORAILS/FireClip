# Hello there. Starting the blog

## changelog

- item lazy loading with incremental back date
- favorite / unfavorite works

## what's next ?

- a blog to post these updates/notes, will also boost SE rankings.
- updating the search to pull all items if wanted (maybe a search window ?)
- beta releases would be nice, configurable in the app.
- endpoint to pull data in between two dates? (backend)
- endpoint to pull n items before some hash. (backend)
- mark as deleteted, keep hash, show as deleted on other devices. (backend)

## notes

worked around 4 hours, feels like it's coming nice together.
